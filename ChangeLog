15MAY2024
ADFlib 0.9.0
- license
  - since this version, the library is on dual license: GPL2 and LGPL 2.1
- api - many changes(!):
  - renamed many functions, constants etc., with the goal
    to provide a separated library namespace
- write support
  - added checking validity of bitmap allocation

  - added adf_bitmap - to view or enforce reconstruction of the block
                       allocation bitmap
  - added adf_salvage - to list and recover deleted files
- devices:
  - cleaned-up and unified device interface for all existing device types
    (dump, native), allowing to easily implement and use new types of devices
    in a safe and controlled way (enabling/disabling types of devices in code)
  - added ramdisk device (to allow eg. faster testing)
- numerous refactorings, improvements and bugfixes, among them:
  - segfault on reading bitmap (rootblock bmpages beyond expected size)
    - several memory leaks (mosly in uncommon cases) and many other
      memory-related issues (thanks to Didier Malenfant!)
  - improved and better tested block allocation bitmap code
- tests
  - many added and/or improved

  - added unit tests (using Check framework)
  - automatic building and testing with GitHub Actions
- code quality:
  - some refactoring and tidying up
- build configuration:
  - added configuration for CMake (besides existing autotools), so that the lib
    can be more portable and build easier eg. with Visual Studio on Windows

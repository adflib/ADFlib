To do and/or consider (no particular order):


* Optimize writing files

  Currently writing does a lot of updates of the file header block (with
  adfFileFlush() - which also writes the block and update allocation map).
  This has some advantages:
  - less data (blocks) lost on a powercut (only the last, incompletely
    saved data block is lost in such case)
  but also some (important) drawbacks:
  - lower performace
  - extensive writing on disks (attention with flash drives!)
  This was done as a relatively quick and safe first implementation, but can
  (and probably should) be (carefully) improved.


* File / file blocks implementation in general

  This is kind of related with the thing above - the file i/o performance
  could be improved and file state management (probably) could be easier
  if some file block cache subsystem was added and separated from file.


* Review all subsystems and add tests

  In particular, directory cache. But also bitmap allocation code or utilities
  like undelete.


* Implement more disk utilities

  undelete, checkdisk, defragment and similar.
  (Some functionality maybe can be in the library, but some probably should go
  to utility programs - like in case of any repair/recovery tools, where
  algorithms/methods used can differ).

  - undelete is partially done with adfsalvage (and src/adf_salv.c)
    the main things left are:
    - add extracting files (do not change the filesystem on ADF, but just
      save files outside, on the local filesystem)
    - adf_salv / adfUndelFile: add reverting of adfCreateEntry() in case
      adfAddInCache() fails
    - consider moving undelete/salvage functionality from the library
      to utilities (not sure if this is necessary in the library...)

* Test "native" (physical) devices

  This is a tricky one and must be done carefully. Probably not possible to do
  automatically in CI, it rather should be done on a VM or some special box
  dedicated for such purpose.

* Test dircache

  So far, there are no "real" images available (only testffs.adf in ADFlib...)
  and, hence, no real need for testing this. But should be done at some point.

* Review and update the API

  Make consistent prefixing in all modules/subsystems, to separate namespace
  of the ADFlib and (in the second part) of a (sub)module.


* Update documentation

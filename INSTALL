General information
--------------------
There are 2 buildsystems that can be used - CMake and autotools (links below).
Obviously, a requirement for building is installation of the chosen one.

Testing require also the Check testing framework for C (link below).

Building deb packages require typical tools for that (helper script uses
debuild from devscripts).

0.7.13 was tested mostly on:
- Debian GNU/Linux 11 (current stable)

and briefly on:
- CygWin (x86_64, Windows 10)
- Visual Studio 19 (Windows 10)
- MacOSX 10.x (Intel)


Building with CMake
--------------------
There are helper scripts in the util/ directory, which should help doing quick
builds. For instance, to build the release version:
1. $ util/cmake_release_configure
2. $ util/cmake_release_build

Debug version (with gdb and address sanitizer, where available...) can be built
in the same way, just replace "release" with "debug" in the commands above.

To clean the build subdirectory use:
   $ util/cmake_clean

(all have to be configured again for building).


Building with Autotools
------------------------
Standard way:
1. $ ./autogen.sh
2. $ ./configure
3. $ make


Building with Visual Studio
----------------------------
Existing CMake configuration should allow to build with VS. Just open
the directory with the project (or possibly clone repo with VS).
It should configure automatically, and it can be build as usual ("Build all").

There are 2 debug and release configurations for VS, allowing to build
a static or a shared (DLL) library. All use MSVC compiler (but this can be
changed easily in CMake settings, eg. to clang ).


Building Debian packages
-------------------------
To build a .deb package for Debian (or any derivative), use the helper script:
  $ util/deb_build.sh

In the parent(!) directory (to that of the project), it will create:
- a source package (.tar.gz)
- binary packages (.deb)

The source package alone can be created with:
  $ util/deb_create_quilt3_archive.sh


Testing
--------
There are 2 sets of tests:
- regtests/ - contain regression and some functional tests (with test data,
  like adf images)
- tests/ - mainly unit tests; require Check testing framework (link below)


Testing with CMake
-------------------
After successful building (see above), automatic tests can be started with:
  $ util/cmake_debug_test   (to test debug version)
  $ util/cmake_shared_test  (for the shared library version)
  $ util/cmake_static_test  (for the static library version)


Testing with Autotools
-----------------------
After successful building (see above), automatic tests can be started with:
  $ make check


Testing with Visual Studio
---------------------------
"Run CTests".

Note that:
- tests with shared library will fail, unless the built library (src/adf.dll)
  is copied to the directories with test binaries (it probably can be fixed
  and done automatically but no time for it now;
  if sb has good solution for this, help welcome)
- tests using shell scripts does not work - they require sh / bash
  (which can installed and configured but not standard things on Windows...)


Installation
-------------
... was not much used / tested. Except for deb packages (which build and
install fine on current Debian stable).

Someday some CI may do more...


Installation with CMake
------------------------
(Note that this was not much used / tested!)

To default location:
 $ util/cmake_release_install

To a custom location:
  $ util/cmake_release_install [custom_prefix]

To install one version of the library (static or shared):
 $ util/cmake_shared_install
 $ util/cmake_static_install


Installation with autotools
----------------------------

To a configured location:
  $ make install

To change default location, do:
  $ ./configure --help

and look for prefix options.


Installation with Visual Studio
--------------------------------

Find produced DLL and EXE and copy wherever you want...
(btw. not sure what CMake install does on Windows...)

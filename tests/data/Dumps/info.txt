Brief info about disk images for testing.

Important note:
  The disk images should be stored in compressed format to avoid excessive
  growth of repo size. Only those added already uncompressed are kept that way.

===============================================================================

Floppy disk images
------------------

Basic ones
----------

blank.adf
testffs.adf
testofs.adf
  - basic tests images with standard DD (880KiB) floppies with OFS/FFS

testhd.adf
  - basic test image of an HD (1760 KiB) floppy 


For specific tests
------------------

arccsh.adf
  - just a typical disk, with couple of tools (like CSH), initially used
    for testing adfinfo (former adf_show_metadata)

cache_crash.adf
  - used in regression test for debian bug 862740 (see: 3c5e7d37)

ffdisk0049.adf.gz
  - FredFisk disk 49, has 2 things useful for tests:
    - bootblock with an invalid root block value
    - bitmap allocation marked invalid (but OK, ie. the same after rebuilding).
    Added just renamed and compressed. The original file:
    https://ftp.grandis.nu/turran/FTP/TOSEC/Collections/Commodore%20Amiga%20-%20Collections%20-%20Fred%20Fish/Amiga%20Library%20Disk%20%230049%20(1987)(Fred%20Fish)(PD)%5bWB%5d.zip

g1a30c.adf
  - for regr. test for a bug, crash on reading bitmap, details:
    https://github.com/adflib/ADFlib/issues/63

links.adf
  - misc. types of links (hard and soft, to files and directories)

test_link_chains.adf
  - another one for testing links (more complex cases, with links to links)

win32-names.adf
  - with files having names non-valid on Windows (for testing unadf)


===============================================================================

Hard disk images
----------------

a590_WD93028XA_6parts_not_formatted.hdd.gz
  - an A590-like HDD disk dump, partitioned on an FS-UAE-emulated A1200 (3.1)
    has 6 partitions without any filesystems (not formatted)

a590_WD93028XA_6parts.hdd.gz
  - like above, but with volumes formatted to every classic AmigaDOS
    filesystem combination: OFS and FFS, +/- INTL, +/- DirCache
